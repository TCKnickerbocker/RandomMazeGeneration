# RandomMazeGeneration

Creates, prints, and solves a randomly generated maze given inputted numbers for the length and width of the maze. Printing a solved maze will print asterisks in every cell spot which has been visited by the solving algorithm prioor to it reaching the end of the maze


Primary code and a test case is all contained within MyMaze.java, while the other files are helper code provided the the U of M's CSCI1933 course for this project
(a generic stack que, the given constraints for what can be used for a cell class, etc.)
